# Carbon Hugo Proxy

This is a simple single file reverse proxy that serves static files generated by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). This proxy is meant to be run with in a [Grader Than Carbon Workspace](https://www.graderthan.com/service/). 

## Motivation

My students want to develop static websites with Hugo on their Carbon Workspaces so they can easily share their content with the world. Many Hugo themes don't handle running from a subdomain well. When hosting the site from the Carbon Workspace, their content is in the Workspace's subdomain. This project was created to resolve this issue. 

## How It Works

1) Starts the Hugo Server and renders the files to disk.
2) Starts a python HTTPServer
3) The users connect to the HTTPServer instead of the Hugo server. Each request loads the rendered Hugo files.
4) If the user makes an edit to their Hugo content, the Hugo server re-renders the files.


## Limitations
